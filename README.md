# Draw

Small in-browser sketch pad. Open `index.html` in your browser and draw with your mouse or touch. Use the controls to change brush color/size/opacity, undo, clear, toggle the eraser, or download your canvas as a PNG.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` deploys the repository root to Pages on pushes to `main` (or via manual dispatch).
- First-time setup: in the repo Settings → Pages, choose "GitHub Actions" as the source.
- After a run, the published site URL will appear in the Pages environment output in the workflow logs.
